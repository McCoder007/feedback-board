- Each user (anonymous or authenticated) can only vote once per item
- Anonymous users have persistent identities across sessions via localStorage
- Users can click a thumbs-up button to add or remove their vote
- The total vote count is displayed next to each item
- Upvoting an item provides immediate visual feedback (animation and color change)
- Visual feedback includes scale, color change, and animations
- Users receive immediate UI updates before server confirmation
- Users can toggle their vote on and off by clicking the same button

### 5. Sharing Capabilities
